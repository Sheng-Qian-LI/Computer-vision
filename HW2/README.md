# **HW2 :  Structure from Motion(SfM)**  

  #### In this homework, I will implement key steps of the Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline to estimate camera poses and generate a 3D point cloud from multiple images. I will use sample images and correspondence matches provided. To succeed, I need to apply concepts such as Camera Projection (intrinsics, extrinsics, and homogeneous coordinates), Multi-view Geometry (essential matrix, fundamental matrix, triangulation), Linear Algebra (singular value decomposition, jacobian), and Python with Numpy. Mastering these will help me reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images and deepen my understanding of computer vision and 3D reconstruction.
